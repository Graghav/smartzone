# Description

Searching across millions of products to get the right product that suits the users' needs on e-commerce websites and applications is a tedious process. Using AI based neural networks, our application uses machine learning algorithms to learn the user's needs by asking a few questions and finds the best product that suits the user's requirements in seconds.
Unlike the filter option currently used in websites, our algorithm compensates the tradeoff between the various requirements and sorts out the best products that will suit the interests of the user.
